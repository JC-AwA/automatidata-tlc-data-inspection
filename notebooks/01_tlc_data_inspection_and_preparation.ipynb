Because while `trip_distance` and `total_amount` are naturally positively correlated (longer trips usually cost more), the `total_amount` is affected by several other factors besides just distance. The `total_amount` includes tips, tolls, and surcharges. For example, a trip might not be the absolute longest in distance, but if it included expensive bridge tolls, heavy traffic (time-based fare), or a very generous tip, it will rank much higher in the `total_amount` sorting than in the `trip_distance` sorting."
